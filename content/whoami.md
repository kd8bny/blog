Welcome! 

My journey in Cybersecurity and Software Engineering has been deeply rooted in Open Source Software.

I launched this blog as a space to document my ongoing projects and explorations and share the insights I've gained with fellow enthusiasts and professionals. 

Here you can expect to find articles on Open Source Software, practical Linux use and configuration, and even my go-to recipes for crafting a good drink.
