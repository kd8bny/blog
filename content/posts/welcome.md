I have been using Cloudflare for a number of years. Moving my domain from its original registrar, Namecheap.
I been thoroughly impressed with their offering and started using a number of their services.

The latest one (sites) comes in the form of the blog!

**Why** Over the last year I've been stepping away from use of social media, which left me with a hole of decent content to skim and learn new things.
This reinvigorated my use of RSS, exploring the topic and rediscovering great content in personal blogs that are often passed by.
So here I am again, trying to leave a positive mark in the world, sharing the work I do professionally and as a hobbyist, in the fields of cybersecurity, software development, system administration, and sharing a good drink.

This blog is still in need of a fitting name.

Welcome to <tbd>! Hope you find something interesting or useful here.
