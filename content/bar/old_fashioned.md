For our first recipe lets go with a classic.

- 0.25oz (bar spoon) demerara simple syrup
- 3 dash Angostura Bitters
- 3oz (90ml) Whiskey

## Instructions

1. Combine demerara and bitters in rocks glass. Give it a stir.
2. Toss in a large ice cube
3. Add whiskey and give another stir
4. Garnish with an orange and/or cocktail cherry
5. Enjoy

### Optional

- Absinthe rinse the glass before adding ingredients
- If using sugar cubes instead of simple, add a bit of water to the cube first before added the bitters.

## Daryl's opinion

I prefer this drink with a Rye base. On your average day i use something like Old Forester. On a fancy day I look for a
Bottle in Bond Rye or Bourbon.

## Story

An old fashioned isn't actually a specific drink but a style. Commonly mixed as a whiskey base, conceptually the recipe can be applied to many bases.
